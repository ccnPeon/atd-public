#. Log into the **LabAccess** jumpserver to prepare the lab environment.

   #. From the Main Menu, type ``labs`` or Option 97 for ``Additional Labs``.

   #. Type ``mesh-topology-ipvpn-labs`` to access the LDP and IPVPN Labs.

   #. Type ``ipvpn`` at the Labs Selection Menu. The script will configure the topology with the necessary prerequisites.

#. We will now leverage BGP as the control-plane for our VPNs in the Service Provider network. Specifically, we will use 
   iBGP with a Route Reflector to ease the configuration load and not require us to setup a full mesh of BGP peerings. 
   Configure **EOS5** as the Route Reflector in the Service Provider Network.

   #. On **EOS5**, enable BGP with ASN 100.  Also set a router-id and disable the IPv4 
      Unicast Address-Family within BGP.

      .. note::

         By default, all BGP neighbors in EOS will try to peer in the IPv4 Unicast AF.  Since we are only leveraging BGP 
         for VPNs and IS-IS is providing our IPv4 underlay, there is no need for this additional overhead. We can change 
         the default state of BGP to **not** attempt to peer using the IPv4 Unicast AF.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            router-id 5.5.5.5
            no bgp default ipv4-unicast

   #. Allow BGP to utilize ECMP when available by increasing the Maximum Paths allowed for a route.

      .. note::

         By default, BGP will only install a single best-path. In a network with multiple equal paths available, this 
         setting will allow BGP to load balance across the available paths. This is covered further in a later lab.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            maximum-paths 2

   #. To simplify BGP configuration, create a **peer group** to apply common BGP attributes to the other EOS nodes in the 
      Service Provider network that will act as Route Reflector Clients. We will peer using iBGP as mentioned and use the 
      router Loopback0 interfaces as the source. Ensure that standard and extended BGP communities and the IP-VPN 
      address-families are enabled for this peer-group as well.

      .. note::

         In EOS, the ``send-community`` command alone will send all communities.  You can selectively enable them if you 
         would prefer to send only extended. Also note that EOS by default includes a ``maximum-routes`` setting of 12,000 
         for all BGP peers to prevent a peer from sending more routes than expected.  This value can be changed per network 
         requirements.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS peer group
            neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS remote-as 100
            neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS update-source Loopback0
            neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS route-reflector-client
            neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS send-community
            neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS maximum-routes 12000 
            !
            address-family vpn-ipv4
               neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS activate
            !
            address-family vpn-ipv6
               neighbor PE-RRCLIENTS activate

   #. Finally, apply the peer group to the necessary routers in the Service Provider network.

      .. note::

         Since BGP is only providing our VPN control-plane, only PE nodes attached to customer devices will require the BGP 
         peering. In this topology **EOS2** is not a PE but a P router and as such will not have any BGP configuration.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            neighbor 1.1.1.1 peer group PE-RRCLIENTS
            neighbor 3.3.3.3 peer group PE-RRCLIENTS
            neighbor 4.4.4.4 peer group PE-RRCLIENTS
            neighbor 6.6.6.6 peer group PE-RRCLIENTS
            neighbor 7.7.7.7 peer group PE-RRCLIENTS
            neighbor 8.8.8.8 peer group PE-RRCLIENTS

   #. Verify configuration on **EOS5**.  Since the other routers are not yet configured, there will be no peerings to check 
      as of yet.

      .. code-block:: text

         show run section bgp

#. Now configure the PE nodes in the Service Provider network as the Route Reflector clients.

   #. Again, this will be iBGP and the peerings will look very similar to the setup on **EOS5**. However, we will not need 
      to leverage a peer group as all PE nodes will only peer with the route-reflector. The below example is for **EOS1**. 
      Repeat this for all other Service Provider nodes with the **exception** of **EOS2**, changing the router-id to match 
      Loopback0.

      .. note::

         On PE nodes, you will see a slightly different AF configuration where we enable MPLS as the data-plane. Since these 
         routers are originating VPNs, we want to ensure they set themselves as the next-hop in BGP when advertising them.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            router-id 1.1.1.1
            no bgp default ipv4-unicast
            maximum-paths 2
            neighbor 5.5.5.5 remote-as 100
            neighbor 5.5.5.5 update-source Loopback0
            neighbor 5.5.5.5 send-community
            neighbor 5.5.5.5 maximum-routes 12000 
            !
            address-family vpn-ipv4
               neighbor default encapsulation mpls next-hop-self source-interface Loopback0
               neighbor 5.5.5.5 activate
            !
            address-family vpn-ipv6
               neighbor default encapsulation mpls next-hop-self source-interface Loopback0
               neighbor 5.5.5.5 activate

#. Once all other PE nodes are configured, verify BGP peerings are in place.

   #. All PE nodes will only have one BGP peer, while the **EOS5** as the route-reflector will peer with all other PE nodes. 
      You will see the peerings as ``Established`` but no routes should be exchanged as no VPNs are configured. Also note 
      that the standard ``show ip bgp summary`` command should have no output since the IPv4 unicast AF is not activated.

      .. code-block:: text

         show bgp vpn-ipv4 summary
         show bgp vpn-ipv6 summary
         show bgp neighbors
