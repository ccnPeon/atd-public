Deploy L3VPN Service for Customer-1
=====================================================

#. Log into the **LabAccess** jumpserver to prepare the lab environment.

   #. From the Main Menu, type ``labs`` or Option 97 for ``Additional Labs``.

   #. Type ``mesh-topology-ipvpn-labs`` to access the LDP and IPVPN Labs.

   #. Type ``c1l3vpn`` at the Labs Selection Menu. The script will configure the topology with the necessary prerequisites.
   
#. Customer-1 is attached to three Service Provider nodes, **EOS1**, **EOS6** and **EOS8**. These will be our Provider 
   Edge, or **PE** nodes. Since this customer will require a Layer 3 VPN Service, create an isolated VRF for their traffic 
   and use IP-VPN to advertise the customer networks to other interested PEs.

   #. Create a VRF Instance called ``CUSTOMER-1`` on **EOS1**, **EOS6** and **EOS8**.

      .. note::

         Since we are using MPLS to create VPNs in the Service Provider network, the VRF only needs to be created on the 
         nodes attached to the customer the VRF is for; in this case Customer-1. Also, note that by default, ``ip routing`` 
         and ``ipv6 unicast-routing`` are disabled by default in any VRF, so must be enabled for routing functions.

      .. code-block:: text

         vrf instance CUSTOMER-1
         !
         ip routing vrf CUSTOMER-1
         !
         ipv6 unicast-routing vrf CUSTOMER-1

   #. Place the interface attached to the Customer Edge, or **CE**, node for Customer-1 into VRF ``CUSTOMER-1`` on 
      **EOS1** to ensure their traffic remains isolated.

      .. note::

         When an interface is moved from one VRF to another, in this case from the ``default`` VRF into our defined 
         ``CUSTOMER-1`` VRF, any IP settings, including addresses, will be removed and will need to be reapplied.

      .. code-block:: text

         interface Ethernet3
            vrf CUSTOMER-1
            ip address 10.1.11.1/24
            ipv6 address fd00:1:11::1/64

   #. Repeat the above step for the interfaces on **EOS6** and **EOS8** attached to Customer-1 CE devices.

      **EOS6**

      .. code-block:: text

         interface Ethernet3
            vrf CUSTOMER-1
            ip address 10.6.13.6/24
            ipv6 address fd00:6:13::6/64

      **EOS8**

      .. code-block:: text

         interface Ethernet2
            vrf CUSTOMER-1
            ip address 10.8.15.8/24
            ipv6 address fd00:8:15::8/64

   #. Now leverage IP-VPN to advertise reachability of any routes learned in VRF ``CUSTOMER-1`` from the customer by 
      setting a Route Distinguisher, or **RD**, and a Route Target, or **RT**, within BGP on **EOS1**. It should have a 
      unique **RD** following the format of **<Loopback0 IP>** ``:1`` and the **RT** on all routers in the VPN should match 
      as ``1:1`` for both v4 and v6.

      .. note::

         The **RD** can be used to determine the origination point of the VPN route and the **RT** is used by the routers 
         in the Service Provider network to determine if they should import the advertised route into their local routing 
         table(s). If they receive a VPN route, they check the **RT** value and see if they have a matching **RT** configured 
         in BGP. If they do, the import the route into the associated VRF. If they do not, they ignore the route.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-1
               rd 1.1.1.1:1
               route-target import vpn-ipv4 1:1
               route-target import vpn-ipv6 1:1
               route-target export vpn-ipv4 1:1
               route-target export vpn-ipv6 1:1

   #. Repeat the above step for **EOS6** and **EOS8**, adjusting the **RD** and using the same **RT**.

      **EOS6**

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-1
               rd 6.6.6.6:1
               route-target import vpn-ipv4 1:1
               route-target import vpn-ipv6 1:1
               route-target export vpn-ipv4 1:1
               route-target export vpn-ipv6 1:1

      **EOS8**

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-1
               rd 8.8.8.8:1
               route-target import vpn-ipv4 1:1
               route-target import vpn-ipv6 1:1
               route-target export vpn-ipv4 1:1
               route-target export vpn-ipv6 1:1

   #. Finally, define the BGP peers facing the CE devices for route exchange into the customer VRF on **EOS1**. The CE node 
      (**EOS11**) will use BGP ASN 123. Ensuring peering is configured for v4 and v6 unicast route exchange to the CE.

      .. note::

         Typically, CE-PE peerings will leverage eBGP as we do here. This allows for automatic route forwarding from the PE 
         to the Route Reflector. Also note that in the previous lab, we disabled the default activation of the IPv4 unicast 
         address-family for BGP peers, so we must explicitly enable for our PE-CE peering as well as the IPv6 unicast 
         address-family.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-1
               neighbor 10.1.11.11 remote-as 123
               neighbor 10.1.11.11 maximum-routes 12000 
               neighbor fd00:1:11::11 remote-as 123
               neighbor fd00:1:11::11 maximum-routes 12000 
               !
               address-family ipv4
                  neighbor 10.1.11.11 activate
               !
               address-family ipv6
                  neighbor fd00:1:11::11 activate

   #. Again, repeat the above step for **EOS6** and **EOS8**, adjusting the peer IPs and ASN to reflect the attached CE node.

   #. Verify configurations and VRF status. There will be no routes or BGP peers in our VRF as of yet since we have not 
      peered with the CE devices.

      .. code-block:: text

         show running-config section CUSTOMER-1
         show vrf

#. Now that the PE nodes are configured, configure CE nodes **EOS11**, **EOS12**, **EOS13**, and **EOS15** for Layer 3 
   attachment to the Service Provider network.

   #. Since **EOS11**, **EOS12**, and **EOS13** represent a single customer site and LAN, configure OSPF to distribute 
      routes locally within the site.

      .. note::

         The scope of these labs is mainly around the Service Provider network functions so it does not cover the specifics 
         of the customer network configurations.

      .. note::

         In the ATD labs, only connectivty of IPv4 traffic can be validated in L3VPNs. There is a limitation in the 
         functionality of vEOS-lab, which the ATD labs are built on, in that it is unable to forward MPLS-decapsulated IPv6 
         traffic to CE nodes. The control-plane for IPv6 based VPNs can still be fully built and validated as it would in 
         a real environment with physical hardware.

         The key fields to notice in the following outputs are the **RD** which denotes the originator of the specified 
         VPN route, the **RT** which denotes the associated Customer VRF and the assigned **MPLS label**, which represents 
         the VPN or VRF label that EOS dynamically assigns via LDP.
