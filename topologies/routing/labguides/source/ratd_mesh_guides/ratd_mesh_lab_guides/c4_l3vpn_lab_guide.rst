=====================================================

#. Log into the **LabAccess** jumpserver to prepare the lab environment.

   #. From the Main Menu, type ``labs`` or Option 97 for ``Additional Labs``.

   #. Type or select the option for ``mesh-topology-evpn-labs`` to access the EVPN Labs.

   #. Type ``c4l3vpn`` at the Labs Selection Menu. The script will configure the topology 
      with the necessary prerequisites.
   
#. Customer-4 is attached to two Service Provider nodes, **EOS7** and **EOS8**. These will be our **PE** nodes. 
   Since this customer will require a Layer 3 VPN Service, create an isolated VRF for their traffic and use EVPN 
   to advertise the customer networks to other interested PEs.

   #. Create a VRF Instance called ``CUSTOMER-4`` on **EOS7** and **EOS8**.

      .. note::

         The steps in this lab will be similar to the Customer-1 L3VPN lab, demonstrating the repeatable nature of 
         an EVPN deployment, which can easily be automated with CloudVision once the concepts are understood.

      .. code-block:: text

         vrf instance CUSTOMER-4
         !
         ip routing vrf CUSTOMER-4

   #. Place the interface attached to the **CE** node for Customer-4 into VRF ``CUSTOMER-4`` on **EOS7** to ensure their 
      traffic remains isolated.

      .. code-block:: text

         interface Ethernet4
            vrf CUSTOMER-4
            ip address 10.7.19.7/24

   #. Repeat the above step for the interface on **EOS8** attached to Customer-4 CE device.

      .. code-block:: text

         interface Ethernet5
            vrf CUSTOMER-4
            ip address 10.8.18.8/24

   #. Now leverage BGP EVPN to advertise reachability of any routes learned in VRF ``CUSTOMER-4`` from the customer by 
      setting an **RD** and an **RT**, within BGP on **EOS7** and **EOS8**. It should have a unique **RD** following the 
      format of **<Loopback0 IP>** ``:4`` and the **RT** on all routers in the VPN should match as ``4:4``.

      **EOS7**

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-4
               rd 7.7.7.7:4
               route-target import evpn 4:4
               route-target export evpn 4:4

      **EOS8**

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-4
               rd 8.8.8.8:4
               route-target import evpn 4:4
               route-target export evpn 4:4

   #. Finally, define the BGP peers facing the CE devices for route exchange into the customer VRF on **EOS7** and **EOS8**. 
      The CE nodes (**EOS19** and **EOS18**) will use BGP ASN 200.

      **EOS7**

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-4
               neighbor 10.7.19.19 remote-as 200
               neighbor 10.7.19.19 maximum-routes 12000 
               !
               address-family ipv4
                  neighbor 10.7.19.19 activate

      **EOS8**

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 100
            !
            vrf CUSTOMER-4
               neighbor 10.8.18.18 remote-as 123
               neighbor 10.8.18.18 maximum-routes 12000 
               !
               address-family ipv4
                  neighbor 10.8.18.18 activate

   #. Verify configurations and VRF status. There will be no routes or BGP peers in our VRF as of yet since we have not 
      peered with the CE devices.

      .. code-block:: text

         show running-config section CUSTOMER-4
         show vrf

#. Now that the PE nodes are configured, configure CE nodes **EOS18** and **EOS19** for Layer 3 attachment to the 
   Service Provider network.

   #. Configure the BGP peerings to the PE devices on **EOS18** and **EOS19** ensuring that each router's Loopback0 
      address is advertised to the attached PE.

      .. note::

         Since both CE devices are using BGP ASN ``200``, we need to ensure BGP allows the router's own ASN in the 
         AS-PATH, which normally is marked as an invalid route, with the ``allowas-in`` option.

#. With the peerings fully established, verify and test connectivity between the Customer-4 locations.
